# Constricter
 Constricter is a begginer proggraming language that will combine multiple languages so the user will learn many different ways to program
 These will include:
  Python,
  C++, &
  Java
The end goal is to have an interpreter for easy testing and a compiler for sharing with their friends.  

 Example:
   ```
   string x = "Hi, "
   out "$x Parker!"
   ---------
   $ constricter hi.con
   Hi, Parker!
   ```
   The `$(var)` is inspired by PHP.
   The var type before name is inspired by 99% of languages.
   The `out` is inspired by a StackOverflow Post
   
 Suggestions are welcome.
 Currently we only have an interpreter.
